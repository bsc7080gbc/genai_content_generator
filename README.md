# genai_content_generator

work in progress ...this is a content generator 


apply. provide content when prompted. type [report] at end, observe for recommendations to generated content. reprocess, report. rinse and repeat until satisfied. final edit by you. done.

content could be a topic, could be existing content. these are not necessary in this format tbh, but I think it's always beneficial to be clear of your intent as it greatly improve the outcome that much more to your desired goal.

```please set topic to and generate content: [topic here]```

```please rewrite this email content: [content here]```

```please rewrite this blog content: [content here]```

```please rewrite this facebook post: [content here]```

```please rewrite this instagram post: [content here]```
